# Introduction to Algorithms

An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a specific task.
Conceivably, every piece of code could be understood as an algorithm, but the more interesting uses of algorithms are explored in the domain of algorithmic study.

This book will compare trade-offs between algorithms, like when to use a merge sort vs. a quick sort, or an array vs. a list.

This book covers the most widely applicable algorithms which will allow you to approach bigger challenges.
