# structures-and-algorithms

repo for projects exploring data structures and algorithms

## Common Things to Have mastered

You should have the following mastered for technical questions:

- Data Structures:
  - Linked Lists
  - Trees, Tries, aand Graphs
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Heaps
  - Vectors and Arraylists
  - Hash tables
- Algorithms
  - Breadth-first search
  - Depth-first search
  - Binary Search
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Concepts
  - Bit manipulation
  - memory (stack vs. heap)
  - recursion
  - dynamic programming
  - big O time and space complexity

## Walking through a problem

- listen and pay close attention to the problem definition
- debug your example if its a special case or if its big enough to exhaust all outcomes of the solution
- get a brute force solution that works
- Optimize that solution looking for:
  - bottlenecks
  - unnecessary work
  - duplicated work
- Once you have an optmized solution, walk through the approach in detail
- Implement your code and modularize it from the beginning
- Then test your code:
  - make sure the concept solutions work
  - check what happens for unusual or non-standard input
  - see what happens with arithmetic and null nodes
  - test it will small test cases
  - test special cases.
    - fix the bugs along the way

Remember to talk through your approach with the interviewer.
